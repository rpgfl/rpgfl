# rpgfl
RPGFL is an RPG engine inspired by RPG Maker in order to combat its limited platforms. Since OpenFL has support for a wide range of platforms, and perhaps consoles at a later date, RPGFL could be an engine that could make your life in the realms of JRPGs a lot easier and without the platform-dependent overhead.

## Roadmap
A lot of what you see is very much in development. This is in a very early stage and most of it is just foundations.

Currently, I am working on getting Tilemaps and the rendering of worlds complete. Once that is functional, and I have a moving player on the screen with a working camera, I will then move onto other things such as the Event system.
